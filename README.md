# Heart-Failure-Research-Project

Cardiovascular conditions and heart disease are considered one of the leading causes of
death worldwide for both men and women. Heart disease has the ability to cause numerous
different types of damages, particularly heart failure, occurring when the heart muscle is unable
to pump blood properly. Around 6.2 million adults in the United States, alone, have heart failure
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“Heart Failure”). Undoubtedly, this
serious result must be addressed and requires effective strategies to alleviate the intensity of the
situation. 

Many machine learning models and algorithms have the powerful ability to predict
certain outcomes by training on data—sometimes more efficiently and more accurately than
regular humans. As a result, certain models could be put to use in order to predict the mortality
caused by heart failure. This could be done based on data that defines possible causes of heart
failure from different patients—such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The utility of high-end
technology, as such, plays a pivotal role in the early detection of heart failure. Early detection is
essential, since preventing these conditions necessitates prior management, including the change
of habits or acquiring certain treatment. When it comes to creating machine learning models, one
of the most imperative results to evaluate is its accuracy percentage. A strong model involves
high preciseness to improve its reliability and evidently obtain more success in prediction. 

Acommon technique, in this case, could include ensemble learning. This project hypothesizes that a
stacked model of common machine learning algorithms may improve the accuracy of heart
failure prediction. This may be done by evaluating all unique combinations of five total
techniques and choosing the best combination. Therefore, what is the most optimal way to
combine multiple different machine learning models, using a stacked generalization technique,
that increases the prediction accuracy of mortality from heart failure?
